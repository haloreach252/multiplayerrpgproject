# Miniverse Studios RPG Project

**Current Version:**
**A0.0.1**

## Project Description
This project is a online multiplayer rpg (not MMO). The servers are planned to be able to have up to 12 people at a time. (This may change later in development).
Not much is known about the project itself, as right now the foundation of the project is being created. It will feature most if not all common RPG game features such as: quests, npcs, loot, etc
Anything in this readme can be changed at a moments notice and should not be taken literally.
